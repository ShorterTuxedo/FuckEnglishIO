# Save My English IO!

A tool to help struggling and dying IB English A: Language and Literature SL students to grind questions on IO or do a practice IO under exam conditions.

This tool reads out the questions to help you prepare for your English IO. 

To use it:
- Edit "questionList.txt" to add your IO questions.
- Edit "ioSimulator.py" to change your name and registry keys for the TTS engine.
- Install required dependencies.
- Run "ioSimulator.py" to start a Mock IO.
- Run "ioQuestionGrinder.py" to grind IO questions.

This tool is designed for Windows and IB English A: Language and Literature SL, but you can modify it for other courses (e.g. Chinese A: Language and Literature HL) or OSes.

本工具为Windows系统和 IB 英语 A：语文及文学 SL 课程设计，不过你可以针对其他课程（如：IB 中文 A: 语言及文学 HL）或操作系统为本工具进行修改。

Finally, what every IB student wants to say out loud:
